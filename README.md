## How it Works // Getting Started

Clone this repository, `cd project6-myreads` and `npm install` to get the required depencies. 

Start the development server with `npm start`

### Notable Information
I opted for a sophistocated component structure. It felt like overkill, but I feel that this is afford me a lot of control over how the components interact.
